### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Gerasimos [:sound:](https://www.howtopronounce.com/gerasimos)
---

### Who am I :raising_hand:
I will introduce myself as an x-professional chess player, an ECE graduate from National Technical University of Athens with a major in Computer Science, and a Fall 2022 PhD applicant :dart: 

I am also into art :art: like a lot! But I also love AI. So, the fusion was inevitable ðŸ’¥. You may guess that I am a tech guy :robot: but what you do not know is that I have always been into literature and ancient Greek as a high-school student :books:. Now it may make some sense why I try to generate philosophical content using Transformers.
